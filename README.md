Title:
United States Mass Shooting Analysis


Problem Statement: 
Analysis of mass shooting data based on time, location, shooter demographics including mental health, and impact of gun laws on these incidents.

By looking at the datasets of Mass shootings the questions I aim to answer or understand are
1. Are there certain states more susceptible to gun violence?
2. Are there certain cities more susceptible to shootings?
3. What are the different locations for these incidents?
4. Are there years in which the incidents are more?
5. Is there a particular month when incidents peak?
6. What is the specific demographic profile for the shooters (Age Group/Race/Gender)?
7. Will the implementation of stricter gun laws have an impact on these incidents?
8. Does the shooter have any prior mental health issues?
   
Background

Every year thousands of people lose their lives or are gravely injured due to gun violence in the United States.
Mass shootings have detrimental effects on the health of the people who witness them, those who live in the communities surrounding them, and those who identify with the demographic groups targeted in them.
Emerging literature shows that mass shootings increase depression and other mental health disorders among teenagers and adults, worsen infant health and reduce overall community and emotional well-being.
It has become extremely urgent to solve this issue since it has such a huge impact on society as a whole.
The United States is recognized as a nation of immigrants, and thousands of individuals move here each year to start new lives.
These incidents have an impact on individuals all throughout the world, not just in one nation.
